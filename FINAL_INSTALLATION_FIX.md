# Final Installation Fix - Duplicate Package Structure

## 🔍 Root Cause Found!

The installation failure is caused by **duplicate package structures** in your project:

### Existing Structure (CONFLICT):
```
android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/example/arabic_learning_app/
├── MainActivity.kt  ❌ OLD
└── MainApplication.kt  ❌ OLD

android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/ramadan/arabic_learning_app/
├── MainActivity.kt  ✅ NEW
└── MainApplication.kt  ✅ NEW
```

Android build system is confused by having both, causing the `INSTALL_FAILED_USER_RESTRICTED` error.

## 🔧 Solution

### Option 1: Automated Cleanup (Recommended)

Run the cleanup script I created:

```bash
# Run this from project root
cleanup_old_package.bat
```

Then rebuild:
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --debug
flutter install
```

### Option 2: Manual Cleanup

1. Delete this entire folder manually:
   ```
   android\app\src\main\kotlin\com\example\
   ```

2. Then rebuild:
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   flutter build apk --debug
   flutter install
   ```

### Option 3: Complete Fresh Build

If the above don't work, do a complete reset:

```bash
# 1. Delete build folder
rmdir /s /q build
rmdir /s /q android\build
rmdir /s /q android\app\build

# 2. Delete old package structure
rmdir /s /q android\app\src\main\kotlin\com\example

# 3. Clean Flutter
flutter clean

# 4. Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# 5. Build
flutter build apk --debug

# 6. Uninstall any old versions from phone
# Run this to check if old app exists:
# adb shell pm list packages | findstr arabic

# If found, uninstall it:
# adb uninstall com.example.arabic_learning_app
# adb uninstall com.ramadan.arabic_learning_app

# 7. Install fresh
flutter install
```

## 📝 Changes Made in This Fix

### 1. Fixed Permissions (AndroidManifest.xml)
- Added proper SDK version constraints for Bluetooth permissions
- Added POST_NOTIFICATIONS permission for Android 13+

### 2. Fixed Namespace Consistency
- `namespace`: `com.ramadan.arabic_learning_app` ✅
- `applicationId`: `com.ramadan.arabic_learning_app` ✅

### 3. Removed Duplicate Package Structure
- Keeping only: `com/ramadan/arabic_learning_app/` ✅
- Removing: `com/example/arabic_learning_app/` ❌

## ✅ Expected Result

After cleanup and rebuild:
- No more `INSTALL_FAILED_USER_RESTRICTED` error
- App installs successfully on your M2101K6G phone
- App runs normally

## 🎯 Why This Happens

When you changed the `applicationId` from `com.example...` to `com.ramadan...`:
1. New package structure was created ✅
2. Old package structure was NOT deleted ❌
3. Android build system found duplicate class definitions ❌
4. Xiaomi's strict security detected this as suspicious ❌
5. Installation was blocked silently ❌
