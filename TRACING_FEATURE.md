# Letter Tracing Feature

## Overview
This feature implements an automated letter tracing system that guides users through drawing Arabic letters by following SVG paths.

## Features

### 1. **Automated Letter Tracing**
- Users trace letters by following predefined SVG paths
- Visual feedback with color-coded paths:
  - **Gray**: Current path to trace
  - **Green**: Completed paths
  - **White**: User's drawing
  - **Yellow**: Next target point

### 2. **Multi-Path Support**
- Handles letters with multiple paths (e.g., letter body + dots)
- Users can lift their finger between paths
- Progress indicator shows completion of each path

### 3. **Progress Tracking**
- Letters are locked until previous letters are completed
- Completion status is saved using SharedPreferences via `UserProgressService`
- Each letter has activities (tracing is activity 0)
- Completing the tracing exercise unlocks the next letter
- Users can retry completed exercises for practice
- Visual indicators:
  - **Lock icon**: Letter is locked
  - **Check icon**: Letter is completed
  - **Color coding**: Green (completed), Gray (locked), Teal (available)
  - **Button states**: Purple (available), Green (completed), Gray (locked)

### 4. **Smart Validation**
- Proximity detection (35px tolerance) for accurate tracing
- Allows users to lift finger and continue from where they left off
- Only resets if user barely started (< 10% completion)

### 5. **Feedback System**
- Real-time visual feedback during tracing
- Success message when letter is completed perfectly (≥85% accuracy)
- Encouragement message if practice is needed
- Attempt counter to track progress

## How It Works

### SVG Path Processing
1. Loads SVG file from assets
2. Extracts all path data using regex
3. Parses paths using `path_drawing` package
4. Scales and centers paths to fit 320x320 canvas
5. Generates tracking points along each path (15px intervals)

### User Interaction
1. User must start from the beginning of each path
2. Touch must be within 35px of the next target point
3. Progress is saved as user traces
4. Completion triggers next path or final evaluation

### Progress System
1. First letter (ا) is unlocked by default
2. Users must complete the tracing exercise to unlock the next letter
3. Tracing exercise is tracked as activity 0 for each letter
4. Progress is persisted across app sessions using `UserProgressService`
5. Users can retry any unlocked letter for additional practice
6. Completing all letters marks Level 1 as complete

## Usage

### In Writing Practice View
1. Navigate to a letter using the page view
2. Click "تدريب تتبع الحرف" (Letter Tracing Practice) button
3. Follow the gray path with your finger
4. Complete all paths to unlock the next letter

### Customization
- Adjust `strokeWidth` in `AutomatedLetterPainter` to change path thickness
- Modify proximity tolerance (35.0) in `onUserDrag` method
- Change accuracy threshold (85%) in `_evaluateDrawing` method
- Adjust point generation interval (15px) in `_loadAndParseSvg` method

## Dependencies
- `path_drawing: ^1.0.1` - SVG path parsing and manipulation
- `shared_preferences: ^2.2.2` - Progress persistence (via UserProgressService)

## Integration with Existing System
- Uses the existing `UserProgressService` for progress tracking
- Tracing exercise is registered as activity 0 for each letter
- Completing the tracing exercise calls `completeActivity(letterIndex, 0)`
- Then calls `completeLetter(letterIndex)` to unlock the next letter
- Integrates seamlessly with the app's level progression system

## Future Enhancements
- Add animation for path direction
- Implement star rating system based on accuracy
- Add sound effects for completion
- Show stroke order numbers
- Add practice statistics and analytics
