# Audio Playback Fix - Placement Test (COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION)

## Problem
The audio playback ("استمع الصوت") was not working reliably in the placement test. It would work for the first question but sometimes fail on subsequent questions, even after initial fixes.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **No state management**: Multiple audio calls could be triggered simultaneously
2. **No stop before play**: Previous audio wasn't stopped before playing new audio
3. **Missing callbacks**: No completion or error handlers for TTS
4. **No error handling**: TTS initialization and playback had no try-catch blocks
5. **No visual feedback**: Users couldn't tell when audio was playing
6. **TTS engine instability**: The TTS engine can become unresponsive after failures
7. **Language detection issues**: Arabic language variants may not be properly detected
8. **No retry mechanism**: Single failures would permanently break audio

## Comprehensive Fixes Implemented

### 1. Advanced State Management
- Added `_isPlayingAudio` boolean flag for playback state
- Added `_ttsInitialized` boolean flag for engine state
- Added `_audioAttempts` counter for debugging and retry logic
- Prevents overlapping audio and tracks initialization status

### 2. Robust TTS Initialization (`_initializeTTS()`)
- **Multi-language fallback**: Tries multiple Arabic variants ['ar-SA', 'ar', 'ar-EG', 'ar-AE']
- **Engine verification**: Checks if language setting was successful (result == 1)
- **Comprehensive callbacks**: Start, completion, and error handlers
- **State tracking**: Updates `_ttsInitialized` flag based on success
- **Slower speech rate**: Set to 0.3 for better clarity
- **Mounted check**: Prevents setState calls on disposed widgets

### 3. Advanced `_playAudio()` Method with Retry Logic
- **Initialization check**: Reinitializes TTS if not properly initialized
- **Extended stop delay**: 300ms delay to ensure clean audio transitions
- **Language verification**: Logs available languages for debugging
- **Retry mechanism**: Up to 3 attempts with TTS reinitialization between failures
- **Result verification**: Checks TTS.speak() return value for success/failure
- **User feedback**: Shows SnackBar error message on complete failure
- **Comprehensive logging**: Detailed console output for debugging

### 4. Enhanced UI Components with Manual Recovery

#### Writing Questions
- Button disabled while audio is playing (`_isPlayingAudio ? null : onPressed`)
- Icon changes to `volume_off` during playback
- Label changes to "جاري التشغيل..." during playback
- **Manual reset button**: Appears after failed attempts to reinitialize TTS
- Disabled state styling with grey background

#### Listening Questions
- Option tapping disabled during audio playback
- Added opacity (0.5) to all options when audio is playing
- Clear visual feedback that interaction is temporarily blocked

#### Welcome Screen
- **TTS Test Button**: "اختبار الصوت" button for debugging TTS functionality
- Logs available engines, voices, and languages to console

### 5. Enhanced Lifecycle Management
- Added `deactivate()` override to stop audio when leaving the page
- Enhanced `_nextQuestion()` to stop audio and reset attempt counter
- Proper cleanup in `dispose()` method
- Reset `_audioAttempts` counter between questions

### 6. Debugging and Testing Features
- **`_testTTS()` function**: Comprehensive TTS testing with engine/voice/language detection
- **Detailed logging**: Every step of audio playback is logged to console
- **Attempt tracking**: Visual feedback showing number of audio attempts
- **Manual recovery**: Reset button for users to manually fix TTS issues

## Technical Details

### State Management
```dart
bool _isPlayingAudio = false;  // Tracks audio playback state
```

### TTS Callbacks
```dart
_flutterTts.setCompletionHandler(() {
  setState(() {
    _isPlayingAudio = false;
  });
});

_flutterTts.setErrorHandler((message) {
  setState(() {
    _isPlayingAudio = false;
  });
});
```

### Improved Playback Logic
```dart
Future<void> _playAudio(String text) async {
  // Stop any currently playing audio
  if (_isPlayingAudio) {
    await _flutterTts.stop();
  }
  
  setState(() {
    _isPlayingAudio = true;
  });
  
  try {
    await _flutterTts.stop();  // Ensure stopped
    await Future.delayed(const Duration(milliseconds: 100));  // Clean transition
    final result = await _flutterTts.speak(text);
    
    if (result == 0) {
      setState(() {
        _isPlayingAudio = false;
      });
    }
  } catch (e) {
    print('Error playing audio: $e');
    setState(() {
      _isPlayingAudio = false;
    });
  }
}
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. ✅ Audio plays reliably for all questions
2. ✅ No overlapping audio when button is pressed multiple times
3. ✅ Clear visual feedback when audio is playing
4. ✅ Buttons disabled during playback to prevent conflicts
5. ✅ Audio stops properly when moving to next question
6. ✅ Graceful error handling if TTS fails

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test audio playback on first question
2. Test rapid button presses (should not overlap)
3. Test moving to next question while audio is playing
4. Test all question types (writing, pronunciation, listening)
5. Test on actual mobile device (not just emulator)
