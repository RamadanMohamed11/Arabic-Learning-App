# Letter Exercises Feature

## Overview
This feature creates a dedicated exercises page for each letter where users must complete various exercises to unlock the next letter. Currently includes letter tracing, with the ability to easily add more exercises in the future.

## User Flow

### 1. **Letter Shapes View**
- User views letter shapes (isolated, initial, medial, final)
- Sees example word with the letter
- Clicks "ابدأ التمارين 💪" button

### 2. **Letter Exercises View**
- Shows all available exercises for the letter
- Displays progress (completed/total exercises)
- Each exercise card shows:
  - ✅ Green checkmark if completed
  - 📝 Icon and description if not completed
  - Progress bar at the bottom

### 3. **Complete Exercises**
- User completes each exercise (currently only tracing)
- Each completed exercise is saved
- When ALL exercises are completed:
  - Success dialog appears
  - Next letter is automatically unlocked
  - User returns to alphabet view

## Current Exercises

### 1. **Letter Tracing (Activity 0)**
- User traces the letter following SVG path
- Must achieve ≥85% accuracy
- On completion:
  - Activity 0 marked as completed
  - Green checkmark appears on exercise card
  - If it's the only exercise, letter is completed and next one unlocks

## Architecture

### File Structure
```
lib/features/Alphabet/presentation/views/
├── letter_shapes_view.dart          # Shows letter shapes
└── letter_exercises_view.dart       # NEW: Shows exercises for the letter
```

### Exercise System
Each exercise is tracked as an activity with an index:
- **Activity 0**: Letter Tracing
- **Activity 1**: (Future) Letter Recognition Quiz
- **Activity 2**: (Future) Writing Practice
- **Activity 3**: (Future) Sound Matching

### Progress Tracking
Uses `UserProgressService`:
```dart
// Mark exercise as completed
await _progressService.completeActivity(letterIndex, exerciseIndex);

// Check if exercise is completed
bool isCompleted = _progressService.isActivityCompleted(letterIndex, exerciseIndex);

// Complete letter (unlocks next letter)
await _progressService.completeLetter(letterIndex);
```

## Adding New Exercises

### Step 1: Define Exercise Index
In `letter_exercises_view.dart`:
```dart
static const int tracingExerciseIndex = 0;
static const int recognitionExerciseIndex = 1;  // NEW
static const int writingExerciseIndex = 2;      // NEW
```

### Step 2: Add State Variable
```dart
bool _tracingCompleted = false;
bool _recognitionCompleted = false;  // NEW
bool _writingCompleted = false;      // NEW
```

### Step 3: Load Progress
In `_loadProgress()`:
```dart
_recognitionCompleted = _progressService!.isActivityCompleted(
  widget.letterIndex,
  recognitionExerciseIndex,
);
```

### Step 4: Create Exercise Method
```dart
Future<void> _startRecognitionExercise() async {
  // Navigate to your exercise screen
  await Navigator.push(
    context,
    MaterialPageRoute(
      builder: (context) => LetterRecognitionScreen(
        letter: widget.letter,
        letterIndex: widget.letterIndex,
        onComplete: () async {
          await _progressService!.completeActivity(
            widget.letterIndex,
            recognitionExerciseIndex,
          );
          await _checkAllExercisesCompleted();
        },
      ),
    ),
  );
  await _loadProgress();
}
```

### Step 5: Add Exercise Card
In `build()` method:
```dart
_buildExerciseCard(
  title: 'تمرين التعرف على الحرف',
  description: 'اختر الحرف الصحيح من بين الخيارات',
  icon: Icons.quiz,
  color: Colors.blue,
  isCompleted: _recognitionCompleted,
  onTap: _startRecognitionExercise,
),
```

### Step 6: Update Completion Check
In `_checkAllExercisesCompleted()`:
```dart
final allCompleted = 
    _progressService!.isActivityCompleted(widget.letterIndex, tracingExerciseIndex) &&
    _progressService!.isActivityCompleted(widget.letterIndex, recognitionExerciseIndex) &&
    _progressService!.isActivityCompleted(widget.letterIndex, writingExerciseIndex);
```

### Step 7: Update Progress Summary
In `_buildProgressSummary()`:
```dart
final totalExercises = 3; // Update count
final completedExercises = 
    (_tracingCompleted ? 1 : 0) +
    (_recognitionCompleted ? 1 : 0) +
    (_writingCompleted ? 1 : 0);
```
